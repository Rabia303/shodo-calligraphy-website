      <center><h2>ORIGIN OF CALLIGRAPHY</h2></center>
      <P>Calligraphy is an ancient art form that has its roots in the Middle East and East Asia. The word "calligraphy"
        comes from the Greek words "kallos" meaning "beauty" and "graphein" meaning "to write."

        Calligraphy developed as a way to beautify written language and was used to produce important documents such as
        religious texts, royal decrees, and official correspondence. As the art form evolved, different styles of
        calligraphy emerged, each with its own unique characteristics, including the development of different scripts
        such as Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese calligraphy.

        Calligraphy has been an important art form for centuries and continues to be appreciated for its beauty and
        elegance. Today, calligraphy is still used for special occasion such as weddings, invitations, and
        announcements, as well as in graphic design and typography.</P>

      <p>Pointed pen calligraphy is a form of calligraphy that uses a thin, pointed nib to create delicate, flowing
        lines.
        This style of calligraphy emerged in Europe during the medieval period and was used to produce illuminated
        manuscripts, official documents, and works of art.</p>

       <p> Pointed pen calligraphy is often referred to as copperplate or Engrosser's script and is characterized by its
        fine
        hairlines, dramatic contrast between thick and thin strokes, and intricate details. The use of a pointed nib
        allows
        calligraphers to create a range of line widths by applying varying pressure, resulting in a more expressive and
        dynamic writing style.
      </p><p>
        Today, pointed pen calligraphy is enjoyed by artists, calligraphers, and enthusiasts around the world. It is
        used
        for a variety of applications, including wedding invitations, greeting cards, and lettering for logos and
        signage.
      </p><p>
        Learning pointed pen calligraphy requires practice and patience, as the delicate nature of the script demands
        precision and control. However, many find the process of creating beautiful, handwritten letters to be both
        meditative and rewarding. Whether for artistic expression or personal fulfillment, pointed pen calligraphy
        continues
        to be a fascinating and timeless art form.</p>

      <h2>broad edge calligraphy</h2>
      <p>Broad edge calligraphy is a form of calligraphy that uses a broad nib to create bold, sweeping lines. Unlike
        pointed pen calligraphy, which is characterized by its fine hairlines and delicate details, broad edge
        calligraphy
        is known for its dramatic contrast between thick and thin strokes and its ability to create broad areas of solid
        color.</p>
<p>
        This style of calligraphy has its roots in ancient civilizations, where it was used for a variety of purposes,
        including inscriptions, signs, and lettering on architectural monuments. In the medieval period, broad edge
        calligraphy was used to produce illuminated manuscripts, including the famous illuminated Bibles of the time.
      </p><p>
        Today, broad edge calligraphy continues to be popular and is used for a variety of applications, including
        wedding
        invitations, posters, and signs. The versatility of broad edge calligraphy makes it a favorite among
        calligraphers,
        artists, and designers, as it can be used to create a range of effects, from bold and dramatic to soft and
        delicate.

        Learning broad edge calligraphy requires practice and patience, as the bold nature of the script demands control
        and
        precision. However, many find the process of creating beautiful, handwritten letters to be both challenging and
        rewarding. Whether for artistic expression or personal fulfillment, broad edge calligraphy remains an enduring
        and
        captivating art form.</p>
